# VRFest
Unity component for VRFest. VRFest enables anyone around the world to attend festivals in virtual reality at a substantially lower cost 

## Inspiration
While concerts are a major source of revenue for artists, they are expensive, time-consuming, and stressful. Moreover, a substantial amount of fans are often unable to attend the aforementioned concerts due to budget and geographical constraints. 

## What it does
VRFest enables anyone around the world to attend festivals in virtual reality at a substantially lower cost. Furthermore, this marketplace is decentralized and based on the Qtum blockchain, in a bid to empower artists with small audiences and to allow ease of exchange of virtual merchandise (apparel for your character, emoticons, dance moves). This platform is comprised of three components: a front-end marketplace that permits the purchase of VR festival tickets and merchandise, the Unity VR environment, and a Solidity-based back-end on the Qtum blockchain to manage transactions and property ownership.

## How we built it
- The virtual reality environment was created with the Unity3D game engine and programmed in C#. All models and sounds were open-source and free on the Unity asset store.
- The front-end mainly uses React and a few dependencies. The website is built using JavaScript, CSS, and HTML. 
- The back-end uses Node.js and Qtum blockchain api for transaction.

## Challenges we ran into
Our team has previously never worked with the Qtum blockchain nor had the majority of us worked with Unity3D and virtual reality, hence the steep learning curve during the initial half of the hackathon.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
VRFest has a beautiful, fluent website design that is sure to entice any potential festival-goers. Moreover, we’re proud of our virtual reality environment set on Mars and populated with dancing ragdolls. Enjoy Sickick’s concert on Mars from the comfort of your living room!

## What we learned
We learned how to interact with the Qtum blockchain as well as virtual reality development.

## What's next for VRFest
Implement the business models, such as a tiered payment system for the artist. In the future, VRFest will have more revenue streams from advertisements, cross-promoting events, and sponsorships.
